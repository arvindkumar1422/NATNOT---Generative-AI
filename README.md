- Virtual environment tools (e.g., venv or conda)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NATNOT---Generative-AI.git
   cd NATNOT---Generative-AI
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project
To start using NATNOT, run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook 3_NATNOT.ipynb
```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to input your data.
- Adjust model parameters as needed to customize the output.
- Review the generated content directly in the notebook.
